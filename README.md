# Probability Purchase Estimator

This application estimates the probability of making a purchase based on the user's current situation. The goal is to provide a probabilistic view to help users make informed decisions. The app is available in two languages: English (EN) and Portuguese (PT-BR).

- **Multi-Language Support**: The app supports English (EN) and Portuguese (PT-BR), allowing users to switch between the two languages.
- **Informational Modal**: An initial modal explains the app's purpose and displays a disclaimer.
- **Probability Calculation**: After selecting options, the user can calculate the purchase and no-purchase probabilities, with the results displayed on the interface.
- **API Integration**: The app consumes an external API to fetch user situation options and calculate probabilities based on the user's selections.

## Technologies Used
